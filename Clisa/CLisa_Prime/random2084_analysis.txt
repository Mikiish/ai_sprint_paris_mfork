random2084Bit() overview
------------------------
The function is defined in casino1031.cpp and returns a 2084-bit integer.
It seeds std::mt19937_64 with std::random_device, then constructs the
integer chunk by chunk using 64-bit calls to the generator.
Finally, it sets the highest bit so the number is exactly 2084 bits.

Purpose: produce large random values for cryptographic testing, e.g. for
Millerâ€“Rabin primality checks in the same file.

Key steps:
1. Create non-deterministic seed via random_device.
2. Initialize mt19937_64 generator.
3. Loop over 64-bit blocks shifting and OR-ing into a cpp_int.
4. Force the 2084th bit to 1 to ensure correct size.

This mirrors Python's os.urandom based approach but stays within C++.
