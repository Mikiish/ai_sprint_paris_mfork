# Cryptodex setup check - 2025-07-19

## Initialization
- Ran `codexinit.sh` which installs Node, clones the OpenAI Codex repo and installs the `codex` CLI.
- Output confirmed installation of Node `v24.4.1` and `codex-cli`.

## CLI verification
- Running `codex --version` returned `codex-cli 0.8.0`.
- Attempted a `codex exec` command; it failed due to missing `OPENAI_API_KEY` which is expected in this environment.

## Repository state
- `.codex` directory exists in `cryptodexx/cryptodex`.
- `config.toml` is present with `approval_policy = "on-failure"`.

This confirms that the cryptodex environment is initialized and Codex CLI is available, though authentication is required for execution.
